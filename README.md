## \# WFSL Shell Guard

## 

## Deterministic command and execution guard for WFSL systems.

## 

## WFSL Shell Guard enforces strict execution boundaries for shell-level operations used within WFSL tooling and pipelines. It prevents implicit execution, dynamic behaviour, and unverified command paths.

## 

## All decisions are made deterministically based on declared policy and invariant rules.

## 

## \## Capabilities

## \- Deterministic command admission

## \- Explicit allow and deny rules

## \- Prevention of implicit or side-effect execution

## \- Evidence-backed execution decisions

## \- Integration with WFSL verification and governance pipelines

## 

## \## Scope

## WFSL Shell Guard operates strictly at the command and execution boundary.

## It does not perform orchestration, remediation, or policy authoring.

## 

## This component enforces decisions defined elsewhere in the WFSL governance stack.

## 

## \## Intended users

## \- WFSL core systems

## \- Licensed WFSL tooling

## \- Internal execution and verification pipelines

## 

## This component is not intended for general-purpose shell usage or end-user scripting.

## 

## \## Licence tier

## WFSL-PAID

## 

## This repository forms part of WFSL’s licensed execution control and verification infrastructure.

## Commercial use requires an appropriate WFSL licence.
