## Governance alignment

WFSL Shell Guard operates under the authority of the
WFSL Control and Execution Governance Charter.

The charter defines the non-negotiable principles governing execution authority,
deny-by-default posture, and control boundaries across WFSL systems.

This project implements execution-level controls that are justified by,
and subordinate to, that charter.
